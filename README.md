## üìÅ Projects

## Week 1 ‚Äì Guess the Song: SNL-Inspired Text Adventure Game
This project is a playful Python-based "Guess the Song" adventure, inspired by an SNL sketch and enhanced with custom visuals created using Canva. Built entirely in a single Jupyter Notebook, this game challenges users to guess the correct musical path through three unpredictable stages of comedic chaos.

## ‚ú® Highlights:
-Game logic powered by user-defined functions, conditional statements, and loops (for & while)
-Three uniquely styled stages, each with song-based decisions and random events
-Includes 5+ variables, 1 list, 1 while loop, 1 for loop, and nested conditionals with else
-Visual enhancements using Canva.
-Designed to be completed in under 3 minutes with multiple possible outcomes
-No global variables or class structures; strict adherence to project requirements


## Week 2 - Regression Modeling: Grocery Getters, Inc.
This case study focuses on predicting customer revenue for Grocery Getters, Inc. using five regression models: Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net, and K-Nearest Neighbors. The notebook includes exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and model selection based on both performance and interpretability.

## ‚ú® Highlights:
-End-to-end regression workflow in Scikit-learn
-Cleaned and transformed data with feature engineering
-Compared models using R¬≤, RMSE, and train-test gap


## Week 3 ü•ê Croissant Image Classifier (Dataiku + MongoDB) - Unstructured Data 
Built a binary image classification model in Dataiku to detect croissants from user-labeled images stored in MongoDB. The project combined unstructured data handling with visual ML pipelines to support a retail business insight.

## ‚ú® Highlights:
Used Dataiku for model training and evaluation
